      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 8, 2025</p>
      
      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern the provision of IT services by DevSolutions ("we", "us", "our"), a company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) under the laws of Pakistan. By engaging our services or using our website, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
      <p>Our services include, but are not limited to: web development, mobile application development, e-commerce solutions, API integration, hosting services, technical consultation, and ongoing maintenance. The specific scope of work will be detailed in individual project contracts or Service Agreements.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Project Requirements and Client Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>Clients are responsible for providing all necessary content, materials, and access required for project completion. Delays caused by incomplete information or materials from the client will extend project timelines accordingly. Clients must have the legal right to provide any content, materials, or data used in our services.</p>
      
      <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
      <p>All custom code, designs, and creative works developed specifically for the client will be owned by the client upon full payment. Pre-existing frameworks, libraries, or tools remain the property of their respective owners. We retain the right to display completed projects in our portfolio unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>Payment terms are specified in individual project contracts. Invoices are payable within 7 days of receipt unless otherwise agreed. Late payments may incur interest at a rate of 1.5% per month. We reserve the right to suspend work on projects with overdue payments.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Project Timeline and Delivery</h2>
      <p>Project timelines are estimates based on prompt client feedback and delivery of required materials. Actual delivery may vary based on the complexity of the project and client responsiveness. Detailed delivery schedules will be outlined in individual project agreements.</p>
      
      <h2>7. Revisions and Changes</h2>
      <p>The number of included revisions is specified in each project agreement. Additional revisions beyond the agreed scope will be billed at our standard hourly rate. Requests for changes to the original project scope may require a revised agreement and timeline.</p>
      
      <h2>8. Acceptance and Sign-off Process</h2>
      <p>Projects are considered complete following successful User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and written sign-off from the client. After sign-off, any changes will be considered new work and may incur additional charges.</p>
      
      <h2>9. Warranty</h2>
      <p>We provide a 90-day warranty on all development work from the date of project sign-off. This covers defects related to the original project scope. The warranty does not cover issues resulting from modifications made by others, misuse, or changes to hosting environments.</p>
      
      <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability for any claim related to our services is limited to the amount paid by the client for the specific service that is the subject of the claim. We are not liable for any indirect, special, or consequential damages arising from our services.</p>
      
      <h2>11. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
      <p>We collect and process personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Client data will be treated confidentially and in compliance with applicable laws. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access or processing.</p>
      
      <h2>12. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>Both parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information received during the term of this agreement. This obligation extends to technical specifications, business information, and other confidential materials.</p>
      
      <h2>13. Termination</h2>
      <p>Either party may terminate this agreement with 30 days written notice. Upon termination, the client remains liable for any completed work. We will provide all completed work files to the client upon request and full payment.</p>
      
      <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of Pakistan. Any disputes arising from this agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Karachi, Pakistan.</p>
      
      <h2>15. Force Majeure</h2>
      <p>Neither party shall be liable for failure to perform obligations due to circumstances beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, war, terrorism, pandemic, or government regulations.</p>
      
      <h2>16. Entire Agreement</h2>
      <p>These Terms, together with any project-specific agreements, constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements. Any modifications must be made in writing and signed by both parties.</p>
      
      <h2>17. Severability</h2>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
