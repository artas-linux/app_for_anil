# Merchant-Ready Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Vision & Design
The project's vision is to build a professional, trustworthy, and compliant IT services website optimized for Easypaisa/JazzCash merchant approval. The design MUST be clean, modern, responsive (HTML5/CSS3 only), and accessible (WCAG-compliant), with subtle animations and clear trust indicators (SECP/NTN badges).

### II. Content Architecture
The website MUST feature a specific content architecture. This includes: a Homepage with a clear value proposition and CTAs; a Services page detailing all offerings; a transparent Pricing page with PKR values; an About Us page with legal details; a Portfolio; mandatory Policy pages (Refund, Delivery, Privacy, AUP); a Contact page; and a functional Checkout Demo.

### III. SEO & Technical Standards
All content MUST adhere to a defined SEO strategy, including target keywords, single H1 per page, alt text on images, and a sitemap. The technical stack is strictly **Static HTML + CSS only**. SSL (HTTPS) MUST be enforced. The footer MUST contain legal details and policy links. The site's Lighthouse scores for performance, SEO, and accessibility MUST be ≥ 90.

### IV. Compliance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The website MUST pass a strict compliance checklist. This includes: visible PKR pricing, all mandatory policies published, a functional demo checkout, and correct legal company details displayed. The settlement bank account name MUST exactly match the SECP entity name. There MUST be no "red flag" terms (e.g., *crypto, forex, wallet, trading, donations*) anywhere on the site.

## Long-Term Goals

The project's long-term goals include adding a blog for SEO, supporting multiple languages (Urdu/English), expanding to include e-learning modules, and performing an annual refresh of SEO and compliance standards.

## Governance

This constitution is the binding standard for all design, content, and technical development. All feature specifications and implementation plans must demonstrate adherence to these principles. Any new services or significant changes must be reviewed for compliance with merchant onboarding policies before being made live.
